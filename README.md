# SimonGame
 
Reimagining of the old Simon memory game in which a gradually increasing sequence of colored shapes flash on the Garmin watch face and must be replicated by pressing the buttons on the watch that correspond with each color in the sequence in the correct order, quickly enough.

The reason to do this project was to become familiar with the Garmin ConnectIQ SDK, MonkeyC, and the various features that come with them.
These include, but are not limited to:
- the interaction between a view and delegate file
- the interaction and transition between pairs of view and delegate files
- how to include drawables on a screen's layout
- how to draw shapes on a screen
- how to play tones
- how to use timers
- how to use action listeners
